                    Kyiv Pechersk Lavra was founded in the late 11th century, around 
                    1051, by monks Antony and Theodosius. Initially, it was a cave 
                    monastery where the monks lived in underground caves they had 
                    dug themselves. The site quickly became popular among pilgrims 
                    due to its holy relics and spiritual life. The Lavra consists 
                    of several grand churches, monastery buildings, and magnificent 
                    architectural complexes.

                    The Orange Revolution (2004) was a mass 
                    protest against electoral fraud, leading to 
                    a rerun of the presidential election and Viktor 
                    Yushchenko's victory. A decade later, the 
                    Euromaidan protests (2013-2014) began over 
                    Ukraine's rejection of an EU agreement, evolving 
                    into a nationwide movement for democracy and 
                    reform. The Revolution of Dignity marked a turning 
                    point, with the ousting of President Yanukovych 
                    and a shift towards a European path, as Maidan 
                    became a symbol of resistance and hope.
